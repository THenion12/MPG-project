# MPG-project
This is a simple project I completed for data mining


This project was done a couple years ago, using data within R.  
The goal was simply to predict MPG based on a number of other vairables.  
I tried a number of simple models, including boosted regression trees and random forest.  
For the project, I used MSE to see what model fit the data better.
The project write up is attached as well.
